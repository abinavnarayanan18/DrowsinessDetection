# DrowsinessDetection
This is a Drowsiness Detection System that uses 68 facial landmarks to draw an eye and track if the eyes are open or closed. Owing to the lightweight but efficiency of the system, this could be deployed anywhere where the monitoring of eyes is necessary. For example, in cars and automobile vehicles deployment of this system would greatly reduce the number of accidents as 40% of the accidents happen due to sleep deprivation.
